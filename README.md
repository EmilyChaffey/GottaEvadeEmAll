# Machine Learning Malware Battle - Gotta Evade 'em All

**Project Description**  
> This project explores methods a malware could use to evade detection by an Anti-Malware System (AMS). It also provides a visualisation program, to enable users to understand what is going on in a game-style animation (which takes as an input the report generated by AMS).
